-module(givingBack).

Joined a reading group and started pushing code into the wild.

Tools for sharing started to become more and more important.

Started just finding things that interested me or were useful and
looked for ways I could give back.

A mention on a mailing list here.
A patch for some public code there.

The joy of learning and sharing started to eclipse the original
motivation of:

           "I need to patch this so it will do what I want"
