Because after you're hooked...
==============================

You discover entire communities of like minded types that say things 
like:
  "Oh you liked <Foo>? Try this <link>, it's a good follow up"

Which pretty much spells your joyful doom. :)

Currently working through a nearly endless stream of incredible material

Books, Academic Papers, Code, Discussions, Blogs, Threads, Videos, Courses...

Nearly all of which is free or near enough. Because it's important to the 
people that created it all, that it is shared and understood.

Sometimes it's difficult to comprehend that such immense amounts of knowledge
are just... there.. Ask me for links... I can provide entire university courses 
on programming language theory, or propositional logic... 

THIS IS THE WAY IT SHOULD BE.
