So many people were so generous with their knowledge.

This enables you to do so much more!

You can never predict if that:
* terrible
* hideous
* probably wrong
* poorly formatted
* etc...

THING that you did, was actually the missing piece someone
needed to solve a problem that had been vexing them for months.

Suddenly you may find yourself in a fasincating conversation or
discussion about your THING.

Try not to become hooked. ;) I dare you.
